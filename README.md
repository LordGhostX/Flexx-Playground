# Flexx Playground

Flexx is a pure Python toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIâ€™s), that uses web technology for its rendering. Apps are written purely in Python; The PScript transpiler generates the necessary JavaScript on the fly. You can use Flexx to create (cross platform) desktop applications, web applications, and export an app to a standalone HTML document. It also works in the Jupyter notebook.
