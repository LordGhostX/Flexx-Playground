"""
The init method

In the above example one can see the use of the init() method, which is a common use in Flexx. It is generally better to use it instead of __init__(), because Flexx calls it at a very approproate time in the initialization process. For example, when init() is called, the corresponding widget is the default parent.

Further, the init() gets the positional instantiation arguments: creating a component Person("john", 32) matches def init(self, name, age)."""

"""Structuring widgets

Flexx comes with itâ€™s own layout system. (Therefore you should generally not use CSS for widget layout, though you can very well use CSS inside a widget).
Any widget class can also be used as a context manager. Within the context, that widget is the default parent; any widget that is created in that context and that does not specify a parent will have that widget as a parent. (This mechanism is thread-safe.) This allows for a style of writing that clearly shows the structure of your app"""
